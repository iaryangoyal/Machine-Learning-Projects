<h2>⚙️ Things to Note</h2>

* Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources because that work will not be considered. Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.
* You can only work on issues that have been assigned to you.
* If you want to contribute the algorithm, it's preferrable that you create a new issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
* If you have modified/added code work, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
* Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in correct folder.
* Do not update the **[README.md](https://github.com/theanshulcode/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/README.md).**

| S.no | Project Name | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|     1.    |  [Data Analysis Of Meteorological Data](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20of%20Meteorological%20Data)  |   It analyzes the meteorological weather data of last 10yrs from 2006 to 2016 at Finland to check an increase of global warming.   |
|     2.    |  [Data Analysis of Student's Performance](https://github.com/theanshulcode/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Analysis/Student's%20Performance)  |   To understand how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by the other variables (Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, Test preparation course).   |
|     3.    |  [Stock Price Predictor](https://github.com/theanshulcode/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Stock%20Price%20Predictor)  |   The challenge of this project is to accurately predict the future closing value of a given stock across a given period of time in the future. For this project I have used a Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 using a dataset of past prices   |
|     4.    |  [Real Time Face Recognition](https://github.com/theanshulcode/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Real%20Time%20Face%20Recognition)  |  The objective of the proposed solution is to recognize a face of a person from a trained data set. The solution recognizes the face and displays the name of the person. The solution is fast and takes less execution time and has a great accuracy even for a smaller number of images in the training data set. It provides a hassle-free solution to an entry and exit management system based on facial recognition in different types of communities. The solution determines the number of times a person has entered and exited through the system where the solution is implemented.    |
|     5.    |  [Customer Segmentation Analysis Using ML](https://github.com/theanshulcode/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20Analysis)  |   The Customer Segmentation has been done using K Means Clustering. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so that companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.   |
